# Minecraft Server Website

Hello everyone, i made almost one year ago a website for a minecraft server named SwiftPvP, they also changed their game server name 
to TurtleMC and made two designs of a website that has been made from scratch.

The website has the following pages:
Home -> Shows news information.
Trailer -> Shows a countdown and after that the countdown is done, it will show the trailer video.
Leaderboard -> It shows the statistics of factions and players.
Staff -> The staff members of the server.
Vote -> a page to vote for the server on multiple platforms.

You have also the option to search for minecraft players and to register and claim your own profile.
They are also profiles for factions.
